# Phonic Boom
My 4 and 5-year-old children are starting to recognize letter names and phonograms. I will leverage their passion for gaming and create a learning experience to solidify these concepts.

This project is built in Unity 3D and uses C# scripting. My approach will direct the player to collect letter blocks, which will spell a word, and every letter collected will play audio for the block name and the letter's phonograms. I will be using scriptable objects for the individual letter blocks.

The final collected word will again be spelled out, play the appropriate phonogram, and say the completed word. I will likely create a word list to achieve this and update the list with suggested words from my child's school.
